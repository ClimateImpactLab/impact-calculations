Computing resources

The only computing resources considered below are those handled by the DMAS system: weather inputs, econometric impacts, and Monte Carlo outputs.  In addition to these, we may be running specialized models, and the CGE will require additional CPU time and space.

CPU resources:

The scale of resources depends primarily on the total number of regions to be estimated.  The approximate time is 0.02 CPU seconds per impact-realization-region.  An impact is a particular function or collection of functions to be computed into a single yearly result, like "property crime".  The ACP had 13 impacts, not include combinations, such as total labor productivity which take less time.  A realization is a single Monte Carlo run for a single set of weather in a single RCP.  The ACP had 1400 weather realizations, and 25 MC collections of each of these.  Since each impact is calculated only for a given set of weather, that weather can only approximate a certain region.  For the ACP, these regions were counties and there were 3144 counties.  So the total time to produce a single realization for the ACP was about 14 minutes, and the total CPU time was 8000 CPU hours.

There are 6.38244e7 km^2 of habitable land on Earth.  The lower 48 states of the US is 8.080464e6 km^2, and we divided it into 3109 counties, or 2600 km^2 per county.  For the entire world at that resolution, we need 25,000 second-level administrative district equivalents.  I just checked an administrative boundary database at the county level for the US, and it had 218,000 regions, but Iâ€™m going to calculate assuming 25,000.

We will also have more impact estiamtes.  If we estimate everything in the master document, we will have by my count about 30 impacts.

We will also hopefully replace the weather realizations with actual model realizations, but maintain about 1400 of these total across all RCPs, and 25 Monte Carlo realizations.

That would be a total of 150,000 CPU hours.  At the prices for CPU time on rackspace (with associated disk space, $0.037/CPU/hr), that comes out to $5500.

Space resources:

Inputs:

Weather data is 0.15 MB per variable-realization-region, where realizations here only include runs of individual models (so 1400 realizations used in the ACP).  The ACP required four variables (precipitation, and mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures) for a total 2.5 TB for all of its weather input data.  Assuming that the GCP needs humidity and wet-bulb variables as well, 1400 realizations, and 25000 regions, it will require 32 TB for inputs.

Outputs:

0.002 MB per region-impact-realization, where impacts now include combinations.  The ACP had 22 impact combinations, for a total of 150 MB per realization in the ACP and 5.25 TB total.  Assuming 35 impacts total and 25000 regions, that's 1.75 GB per realization, and 60 TB total.

Rackspace provides cloud diskspace at $0.08 / GB/month.  If we wanted to use 92 TB for 12 months, that would cost $90,000.   It is now possible to get 3 TB drives for $99 each ($0.03 / GB), which would be $3400 including tax.  However, we still need to pay for download the outputs (uploads are free), at about $0.10/GB or $6000.
