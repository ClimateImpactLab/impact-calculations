# Options for the generate system

The generate system takes a configuration file, typically stored in
`configs/`.  That file can take many options, a few of which are now
listed here:

 - `rcp_only`: The name of an RCP to run (rather than all available
   RCPs), in the form `rcp26`.
 - `only-models`: Either a single GCM name or a list of GCMs.
 - `include_patterns`: True or false, to include pattern models.
