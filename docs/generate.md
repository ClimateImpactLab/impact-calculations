# Options for the generate system

The generate system takes a configuration file, typically stored in
`configs/`.  Below are additional configuration options that can be
included in the generate configuration file.

 - `only-rcp` or `rcp`: The name of an RCP to run (rather than all available
   RCPs), in the form `rcp26`.
 - `only-models`: Either a single GCM name or a list of allowed GCMs.
 - `include-patterns`: true or false; produce results for pattern models
 - `only-ssp` or `ssp`: The name of an SSP to use (e.g., `SSP3`), or a list of SSPs.
