The mortality sector supports a bunch of configuration options, which should probably be documented at some point.  This describes a subset of those.

## Clipping

The default limits for the region-specific temperature at which the minimum mortality temperature is allowed is 10C and 25.  These can be adjusted with the `clip-mintemp` and `clip-maxtemp` configuration options, with an option like `clip-maxtemp: 30`.
