* `csvv-organization`:
  Typically blank, but may be included if the CSVV file has the
  following known organizational scheme:
  - `three-ages`: The parameters are grouped in thirds, with the first
    third for young people (and intended for files with a `-young`
    suffix); the second third for older (suffix `-older`), and the
    third third for oldest (suffix `-oldest`).
