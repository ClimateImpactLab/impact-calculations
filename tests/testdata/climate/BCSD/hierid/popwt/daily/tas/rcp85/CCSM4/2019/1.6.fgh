description: 'Powers of daily average temperature


  Values are daily mean temperature raised to various powers for use in polynomial
  response functions, aggregated to impact regions/hierids using population weights.
  Data is reported at the daily level using a 365-day calendar (leap years excluded)
  in the format YYYYDDD.


  version 1.6 An error in the NASA BCSD files in which daily      tasmin was sometimes
  greater than daily tasmax was corrected      by masking out the problem grid cells
  in both tasmin and tasmax,      and then linearly interpolating over those regions.      This
  correction slightly changes their resulting average (tas).


  version 1.5 fixes another bug in which grid cells with zero population were     replaced
  with backup (area) weights. This is incorrect - only NaN values     should be replaced.


  version 1.4 fixes a bug which dropped regions with no population. Now, these     regions
  draw on gridded data using backup (area) weights.


  version 1.3 updated with correct K --> C conversion (273.15, not 237.15). Kudos    to
  @jrising for the catch.


  version 1.1 and 1.2 updated metadata to conform to @jrising''s spec
